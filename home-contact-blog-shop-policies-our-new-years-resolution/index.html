Phone: (573) 368-8079 Email: contact@scenicorg.com    When We Say "Customized", We Mean It    September 4, 2015    Every family has their own unique organizing needs. Your lifestyle is different from everyone else's, so why should you follow the same organizing rules? Maybe you don't need a paper calendar to organize your schedule. Maybe you want something that fits your home decor. Or maybe you need custom-built garage storage, because the store-bought ones just don't cut it.  We live in a world where everything we buy is standardized, which doesn't always suit our needs. We can help with that.  We have individuals in our network that can build that custom storage rack, shelf, command center, or even spice rack! Here are a couple of projects that we have produced.     As organizers, we are innovative and creative. We know that not every person, or every home, fits the same mold. We can help you come up with an idea AND bring it to life. If you already have an idea, but just need someone to produce it, we can do that too. Call or text (573) 368-8079, or use the Contact page to get a free quote. We look forward to organizing with you!   6 Ways an Organizer Can Change Your Life August 28, 2015   1. You are moving into a new home, but you don’t have time to organize how you’d like to. Let’s face it, living out of boxes and suitcases isn’t exactly glamorous. You want to show off your shiny new abode to your family and friends, but you haven’t unpacked. Or, you want to start parking for the move, but you don’t know where to begin.  Begin by picking up that phone and calling Scenic. Many times we do promotions to make your initial consultation low-cost. We’ll help you sort out your goals, and you decide whether you want to move forward with a hands-on organizing session.  2. You need help with functionality.  You have a beautiful glass coffee table, but it quickly becomes covered with mail and magazines. You never fully enjoy your home.  Scenic can suggest creative, yet practical solutions for storage, displays, and other organization areas. We do an initial consultation with you to assess the space, and we’ll suggest solutions to fit your needs.  3. Your home office is no longer a place you want to work in. You have paperwork, receipts, mail, and files everywhere. Maybe you just get tired of reaching, straining, and stretching to get things.  We will help you file, scan, categorize, shred, and label your office to make the stressful paper disappear. We can even help you configure an office layout that promotes smooth workflow.  4. Your house isn’t a mess, but you’re wondering if there’s an easier way to stay organized. Organization isn’t a destination, it is a continuous process. As your lifestyle changes, you may need updates to keep things running smoothly.  Set up an initial, 1-hour consultation with us and we can come up with a plan, together.  5. You want to organize, but you need help coming up with a game-plan. You are a Do-It-Yourself kind of person, so you want to organize your way. You have lots of creative ideas, but you need help narrowing it down.  Let’s get together for an initial consultation, and we can narrow down your goals. We can even suggest materials that could be helpful for the project. We can give you advice on techniques that we use to keep things orderly.  6. You have kids. Your children are the light of your life, and you work hard to keep them happy. You are busy making sure they get a good education, are well nourished, and have a good social life. You don’t have much time to sort through old clothes, toys, and memorabilia that has accrued.  We will help you sort, donate, preserve, display, and store things that are collecting around your home. Not only will we do that, but we can come up with a system to stay on top of these things. Set up an initial consultation today. We’ll work around your busy schedule.   Back to School Organization Tips August 26, 2015    We know how stressful getting your kids back to school can be. Your drawers are packed with school registration papers, immunization records, and art projects. All of the information you could ever need is in there, but you can never find it fast enough. The towering pile of paperwork can quickly get out of hand. Especially when registration day comes around. Oh, the joy! We want to help out. Here are a few tips on how to control the chaos.  1. Sort Sort all of your papers into categories. The categories depend on your individual needs, but I recommend something like this… · Registration documents · Health records · Extra curricular · Grade cards · Awards · Art projects Each child should have their own stack.  2. File If you don’t have an extreme amount of paper, you can use a file folder with each child’s name on it and the year with tab dividers for each. If you simply have way too much paper, then buy an expanding file for each child, write their name and the year on the front, and write your categories on the tabs. So simple!  3. Reduce Take photos of the large or oddly shaped art projects that were so graciously gifted to you on mother’s day. It is a beautiful piece of art, and you will remember the fuzzy feelings you got even when it is in photo form. Recycle the real version, or put it into a storage container with your kid’s name on it and the year. Whatever you do to get it off of the kitchen table!  4. Set up a command Center This is my favorite trick of all time. Every day, you may come home and get a plethora of grade cards, art projects, waivers to sign, homework to check, but what do you do with these things? You need to create a visible filing system where you can see what you have. My command center includes a place for immediate use documents, and a place for later use documents. For example, your bank statements, tax forms, grade cards, and health records can go into the later use, while your coupons, bills, field trip waivers, and anything that needs a response can go into the immediate use section. You’ll always remember to pay the trash bill if it is right in front of you. You can periodically empty the later use documents into your permanent filing system when time allows. Here are some examples.      There are so many great ways to get organized. Your friendly professional organizer can even help you get organized with major projects that you simply aren’t able to do yourself! Contact us now for a free quote.

The Kitchen's Daily Needs List  3 3 Big-Impact Recycling Hacks June 25, 2015   Commonly recycled items include paper, plastic, glass, and metal. Other recycling categories exist, but many people have these four main groups, according to springfieldmo.gov.  Some of these recycling bins can be bulky, and difficult to keep organized in your home. We can help you f find a good way to tame the chaos! Here are a few clever ways to organize your recycling. 1. Stack it up! Y You can build racks to stack your recycling bins, but accessing those bins without having to pull them out of their cubby can be a nuisance.

Find it here:http://familyhandyman.com/storage-organization/garage-organization-create-recycle-bin-hangers/view-all   3. Hide it If you don’t like the bulky bins, you can always hide them.

You can always clean, so why not take this time to organize instead. We've taken a traditional Spring Cleaning Checklist and translated it into a list of what your home really needs. 1. Vacuum and shampoo the rugs Translation: pick up all of the shoes sitting on the rugs in your home, and organize them. You can throw out the ones that are damaged and sell or donate the ones you don’t wear or your children grew out of. What do you do with the ones you keep? You can use; Shoe racks Over-the-door closet organizers Flip flop closet hangers  2. Dust books and shelves Translation: send your overdue books back to the library! Find a new home for books that you are never going to read again. If looking at your overflowing bookshelf doesn’t make you happy, then change it. One thing that I’ve learned to do with my shelf is take each book, one by one, and decide if I’m ever going to read it again. If not, I can donate it, sell it, or gift it to a friend.  That goes for knick knacks as well. If a certain knick knack doesn’t bring you a spark of fond memories or happiness when you look at it, then you might not need it anymore. It has served its purpose, and someone else might have more use for it than you do.  3. Clean the furniture Translation: Take all of the cushions off of your couches, and dig out the toys, loose change, candy wrappers, etc. that you find. Put the loose change in a savings jar, throw out all the trash, and then decide what to do with those really old (does my kid even want these anymore?) toys.  4. Wax the tables and wooden surfaces Translation: You can’t really wax your tables with paper, pens, and any other assortment of items all over it. Sort these items into categories. For example; Office supplies Children’s artwork Bills Groceries/food items Then, put everything away, category by category, until your tables are all cleared off. You can start eating dinner at the table again!  5. Clean window treatments You probably should clean your window treatments. This would be a good time to throw them in the laundry. It will help reduce the amount of dust in the air, and allergies! Achoo!  6. Sweep, mop, and wax the floors T Translation: Pick everything up off of the floors. Sort them into categories like; Laundry Trash Toys Hygiene/ bathroom items Dishes Pens, crayons, markers, art supplies Things you need to file (receipts, insurance policies, warranties) Then, work on putting everything away, category by category, until you can walk around without stepping on Legos.  7. Dust refrigerator coils Translation: Instead, you can go through everything in your fridge. Throw out anything that is past its expiration (whether it is moldy or not). Sort your items into categories like dairy, meats, fruits, vegetables, and condiments.  8. Switch out blankets This one is actually a good one. Swap your microfiber sheets for cotton or silk ones. Change out your down comforter for a summer quilt.  9. Mattresses  While you’re at it, you can flip or turn your mattresses, so they don’t wear too much on one side or another. You’ll save money because it will reduce wear and tear.  10. Clean out the closets If you don’t feel like going through every single item in your closet, at least switch out your fall and winter clothes for spring and summer ones. Store your coats, heavy jackets, gloves, scarves, and hats together in a tote. Put long sleeves, sweaters, thermals, and sweat pants into another. Put the totes away so they aren’t in the way. Don’t forget to label your totes, or you will forget that you even had the stuff to begin with.  One way to get out of doing this every season is to do a little at a time, every day. If you set aside 5 minutes to sort through & file your mail every day, or 10 minutes to clear the floors then your home will start to look better and better.    7 Steps to Get Organized June 11, 2015    You have several areas in your home that need organizing, how do you know where to begin? It can be overwhelming, but these few tips will help you conquer the task. You can start by answering these questions: Which area is used most often, or has the most traffic? Will organizing this area give you more space or resources to aid in completing your other projects? (For example: organizing my bedroom will give me more room to organize my closet later). Is this project critical in order to get something else done?  1. Pick Your Project Use the questions listed above! You want to create a big impact with each organization project. This will help you see the most progress. It might not be what you WANT to do, but it’s what you need to do first.  2. Set Goals What do you want to accomplish during your organizing project? Your goals need to be realistic, and specific. For example, I will sort through all of my clothing and decide what to keep, donate, and throw away by 5pm tomorrow.  3. Make Room You will need a clean, clear work space to organize with. Whether you are organizing paper, files, jewelry, clothing, or even dishes. It will save the stress of trying to work around other messes, and you will be less likely to lose things.  4. Categorize Sort your items into categories. This will make it easier to put similar things close to one another, and you will be less likely to forget where you put them.  5. Give it a Home Each item in your home or office should have a permanent “home,” or a place that it goes back to EVERY TIME it is removed. If an item doesn’t have a home, you need to decide whether you need it or not. If you DO need it, create a home for it.  6. Stay on Track Do you often find yourself doing side-projects that you never intended to do? Put this side-project on the back burner for now. The fewer projects that you are involved with at one time, the faster you will be able to to complete your main project. It will keep you more motivated to know that you’re knocking projects out, one-by-one.  7. Maintain Take 5 minutes a day to file your mail, 10 minutes to fold laundry, or put things back exactly where you found them. You will have much more time to live a stress-free, clutter-free life if you do a little every day.    What Does a Professional Organizer Do? June 1, 2015     Many people ask us, what does a professional organizer do?  Not all organizing consultations are dramatic makeovers like you see on TV. Most jobs are done with only one or two organizers. Professional organizers will come to your home or office and help you create an organizing system, while teaching you valuable, lifelong organization skills that will help you STAY organized.  Do I have to throw things away?  A professional organizer won’t force you to get rid of anything, or throw something away without your permission. You will always get to make the final decision on what happens to your belongings. It’s all a part of the process! With you in the driver’s seat, we are able to create a customized system that will work for you, long-term. Your organizer will also guide you through making difficult decisions.  Do I have to be there while you organize?  An organizer will organize along side you, so that you can learn methods to stay organized on your own. Think of it as a learning experience. You get pointers along the way, coaching, and mentoring in addition to a gorgeous, new, workable area of your home/office. Some clients really get into the organizing and have fun with it, which makes it an awesome experience for both of us!  Is it like a cleaning service?  Professional organizers typically don’t clean, (sweep, mop, sanitize, wash laundry or dishes) for you. There are cleaning services specifically for that. We help you develop and implement creative solutions to your space. We want to help transfer our knowledge to you in a hands-on environment, so you can gain new skills to live a clutter-free life.  How long will it take?  That depends, how big is the space? How much stuff do you have? Do you take more time to make decisions? A professional organizer will want to view the area, and may suggest a package that will work best for you. To schedule a 1-hour consultation, contact us. We’ll be able to help you come up with a game plan for organizing your space. To find a list of services, visit our Services page.     4002 W. TRACY ST.

Your lifestyle is different from everyone else's, so why should you follow the same organizing rules? Maybe you don't need a paper calendar to organize your schedule. Maybe you want something that fits your home decor. Or maybe you need custom-built garage storage, because the store-bought ones just don't cut it.  We live in a world where everything we buy is standardized, which doesn't always suit our needs. We can help with that.  We have individuals in our network that can build that custom storage rack, shelf, command center, or even spice rack! Here are a couple of projects that we have produced.     As organizers, we are innovative and creative. We know that not every person, or every home, fits the same mold. We can help you come up with an idea AND bring it to life. If you already have an idea, but just need someone to produce it, we can do that too. Call or text (573) 368-8079, or use the Contact page to get a free quote. We look forward to organizing with you!   6 Ways an Organizer Can Change Your Life August 28, 2015   1. You are moving into a new home, but you don’t have time to organize how you’d like to. Let’s face it, living out of boxes and suitcases isn’t exactly glamorous. You want to show off your shiny new abode to your family and friends, but you haven’t unpacked. Or, you want to start parking for the move, but you don’t know where to begin.  Begin by picking up that phone and calling Scenic. Many times we do promotions to make your initial consultation low-cost. We’ll help you sort out your goals, and you decide whether you want to move forward with a hands-on organizing session.  2. You need help with functionality.  You have a beautiful glass coffee table, but it quickly becomes covered with mail and magazines. You never fully enjoy your home.  Scenic can suggest creative, yet practical solutions for storage, displays, and other organization areas. We do an initial consultation with you to assess the space, and we’ll suggest solutions to fit your needs.  3. Your home office is no longer a place you want to work in. You have paperwork, receipts, mail, and files everywhere. Maybe you just get tired of reaching, straining, and stretching to get things.  We will help you file, scan, categorize, shred, and label your office to make the stressful paper disappear. We can even help you configure an office layout that promotes smooth workflow.  4. Your house isn’t a mess, but you’re wondering if there’s an easier way to stay organized. Organization isn’t a destination, it is a continuous process. As your lifestyle changes, you may need updates to keep things running smoothly.  Set up an initial, 1-hour consultation with us and we can come up with a plan, together.  5. You want to organize, but you need help coming up with a game-plan. You are a Do-It-Yourself kind of person, so you want to organize your way. You have lots of creative ideas, but you need help narrowing it down.  Let’s get together for an initial consultation, and we can narrow down your goals. We can even suggest materials that could be helpful for the project. We can give you advice on techniques that we use to keep things orderly.  6. You have kids. Your children are the light of your life, and you work hard to keep them happy. You are busy making sure they get a good education, are well nourished, and have a good social life. You don’t have much time to sort through old clothes, toys, and memorabilia that has accrued.  We will help you sort, donate, preserve, display, and store things that are collecting around your home. Not only will we do that, but we can come up with a system to stay on top of these things. Set up an initial consultation today. We’ll work around your busy schedule.   Back to School Organization Tips August 26, 2015    We know how stressful getting your kids back to school can be. Your drawers are packed with school registration papers, immunization records, and art projects. All of the information you could ever need is in there, but you can never find it fast enough. The towering pile of paperwork can quickly get out of hand. Especially when registration day comes around. Oh, the joy! We want to help out. Here are a few tips on how to control the chaos.  1. Sort Sort all of your papers into categories. The categories depend on your individual needs, but I recommend something like this… · Registration documents · Health records · Extra curricular · Grade cards · Awards · Art projects Each child should have their own stack.  2. File If you don’t have an extreme amount of paper, you can use a file folder with each child’s name on it and the year with tab dividers for each. If you simply have way too much paper, then buy an expanding file for each child, write their name and the year on the front, and write your categories on the tabs. So simple!  3. Reduce Take photos of the large or oddly shaped art projects that were so graciously gifted to you on mother’s day. It is a beautiful piece of art, and you will remember the fuzzy feelings you got even when it is in photo form. Recycle the real version, or put it into a storage container with your kid’s name on it and the year. Whatever you do to get it off of the kitchen table!  4. Set up a command Center This is my favorite trick of all time. Every day, you may come home and get a plethora of grade cards, art projects, waivers to sign, homework to check, but what do you do with these things? You need to create a visible filing system where you can see what you have. My command center includes a place for immediate use documents, and a place for later use documents. For example, your bank statements, tax forms, grade cards, and health records can go into the later use, while your coupons, bills, field trip waivers, and anything that needs a response can go into the immediate use section. You’ll always remember to pay the trash bill if it is right in front of you. You can periodically empty the later use documents into your permanent filing system when time allows. Here are some examples.      There are so many great ways to get organized. Your friendly professional organizer can even help you get organized with major projects that you simply aren’t able to do yourself! Contact us now for a free quote.

The Kitchen's Daily Needs List  3 3 Big-Impact Recycling Hacks June 25, 2015   Commonly recycled items include paper, plastic, glass, and metal. Other recycling categories exist, but many people have these four main groups, according to springfieldmo.gov.  Some of these recycling bins can be bulky, and difficult to keep organized in your home. We can help you f find a good way to tame the chaos! Here are a few clever ways to organize your recycling. 1. Stack it up! Y You can build racks to stack your recycling bins, but accessing those bins without having to pull them out of their cubby can be a nuisance. Especially if you are teaching your little ones how t to recycle. You can easily toss your recyclables in,and have much more floor space.

You can always clean, so why not take this time to organize instead. We've taken a traditional Spring Cleaning Checklist and translated it into a list of what your home really needs. 1. Vacuum and shampoo the rugs Translation: pick up all of the shoes sitting on the rugs in your home, and organize them. You can throw out the ones that are damaged and sell or donate the ones you don’t wear or your children grew out of. What do you do with the ones you keep? You can use; Shoe racks Over-the-door closet organizers Flip flop closet hangers  2. Dust books and shelves Translation: send your overdue books back to the library! Find a new home for books that you are never going to read again. If looking at your overflowing bookshelf doesn’t make you happy, then change it. One thing that I’ve learned to do with my shelf is take each book, one by one, and decide if I’m ever going to read it again. If not, I can donate it, sell it, or gift it to a friend.  That goes for knick knacks as well. If a certain knick knack doesn’t bring you a spark of fond memories or happiness when you look at it, then you might not need it anymore. It has served its purpose, and someone else might have more use for it than you do.  3. Clean the furniture Translation: Take all of the cushions off of your couches, and dig out the toys, loose change, candy wrappers, etc. that you find. Put the loose change in a savings jar, throw out all the trash, and then decide what to do with those really old (does my kid even want these anymore?) toys.  4. Wax the tables and wooden surfaces Translation: You can’t really wax your tables with paper, pens, and any other assortment of items all over it. Sort these items into categories. For example; Office supplies Children’s artwork Bills Groceries/food items Then, put everything away, category by category, until your tables are all cleared off. You can start eating dinner at the table again!  5. Clean window treatments You probably should clean your window treatments. This would be a good time to throw them in the laundry. It will help reduce the amount of dust in the air, and allergies! Achoo!  6. Sweep, mop, and wax the floors T Translation: Pick everything up off of the floors. Sort them into categories like; Laundry Trash Toys Hygiene/ bathroom items Dishes Pens, crayons, markers, art supplies Things you need to file (receipts, insurance policies, warranties) Then, work on putting everything away, category by category, until you can walk around without stepping on Legos.  7. Dust refrigerator coils Translation: Instead, you can go through everything in your fridge. Throw out anything that is past its expiration (whether it is moldy or not). Sort your items into categories like dairy, meats, fruits, vegetables, and condiments.  8. Switch out blankets This one is actually a good one. Swap your microfiber sheets for cotton or silk ones. Change out your down comforter for a summer quilt.  9. Mattresses  While you’re at it, you can flip or turn your mattresses, so they don’t wear too much on one side or another. You’ll save money because it will reduce wear and tear.  10. Clean out the closets If you don’t feel like going through every single item in your closet, at least switch out your fall and winter clothes for spring and summer ones. Store your coats, heavy jackets, gloves, scarves, and hats together in a tote. Put long sleeves, sweaters, thermals, and sweat pants into another. Put the totes away so they aren’t in the way. Don’t forget to label your totes, or you will forget that you even had the stuff to begin with.  One way to get out of doing this every season is to do a little at a time, every day. If you set aside 5 minutes to sort through & file your mail every day, or 10 minutes to clear the floors then your home will start to look better and better.    7 Steps to Get Organized June 11, 2015    You have several areas in your home that need organizing, how do you know where to begin? It can be overwhelming, but these few tips will help you conquer the task. You can start by answering these questions: Which area is used most often, or has the most traffic? Will organizing this area give you more space or resources to aid in completing your other projects? (For example: organizing my bedroom will give me more room to organize my closet later). Is this project critical in order to get something else done?  1. Pick Your Project Use the questions listed above! You want to create a big impact with each organization project. This will help you see the most progress. It might not be what you WANT to do, but it’s what you need to do first.  2. Set Goals What do you want to accomplish during your organizing project? Your goals need to be realistic, and specific. For example, I will sort through all of my clothing and decide what to keep, donate, and throw away by 5pm tomorrow.  3. Make Room You will need a clean, clear work space to organize with. Whether you are organizing paper, files, jewelry, clothing, or even dishes. It will save the stress of trying to work around other messes, and you will be less likely to lose things.  4. Categorize Sort your items into categories. This will make it easier to put similar things close to one another, and you will be less likely to forget where you put them.  5. Give it a Home Each item in your home or office should have a permanent “home,” or a place that it goes back to EVERY TIME it is removed. If an item doesn’t have a home, you need to decide whether you need it or not. If you DO need it, create a home for it.  6. Stay on Track Do you often find yourself doing side-projects that you never intended to do? Put this side-project on the back burner for now. The fewer projects that you are involved with at one time, the faster you will be able to to complete your main project. It will keep you more motivated to know that you’re knocking projects out, one-by-one.  7. Maintain Take 5 minutes a day to file your mail, 10 minutes to fold laundry, or put things back exactly where you found them. You will have much more time to live a stress-free, clutter-free life if you do a little every day.    What Does a Professional Organizer Do? June 1, 2015     Many people ask us, what does a professional organizer do?  Not all organizing consultations are dramatic makeovers like you see on TV. Most jobs are done with only one or two organizers. Professional organizers will come to your home or office and help you create an organizing system, while teaching you valuable, lifelong organization skills that will help you STAY organized.  Do I have to throw things away?  A professional organizer won’t force you to get rid of anything, or throw something away without your permission. You will always get to make the final decision on what happens to your belongings. It’s all a part of the process! With you in the driver’s seat, we are able to create a customized system that will work for you, long-term. Your organizer will also guide you through making difficult decisions.  Do I have to be there while you organize?  An organizer will organize along side you, so that you can learn methods to stay organized on your own. Think of it as a learning experience. You get pointers along the way, coaching, and mentoring in addition to a gorgeous, new, workable area of your home/office. Some clients really get into the organizing and have fun with it, which makes it an awesome experience for both of us!  Is it like a cleaning service?  Professional organizers typically don’t clean, (sweep, mop, sanitize, wash laundry or dishes) for you. There are cleaning services specifically for that. We help you develop and implement creative solutions to your space. We want to help transfer our knowledge to you in a hands-on environment, so you can gain new skills to live a clutter-free life.  How long will it take?  That depends, how big is the space? How much stuff do you have? Do you take more time to make decisions? A professional organizer will want to view the area, and may suggest a package that will work best for you. To schedule a 1-hour consultation, contact us. We’ll be able to help you come up with a game plan for organizing your space. To find a list of services, visit our Services page.     4002 W. TRACY ST.

You can always clean, so why not take this time to organize instead. We've taken a traditional Spring Cleaning Checklist and translated it into a list of what your home really needs. 1.

You can throw out the ones that are damaged and sell or donate the ones you don’t wear or your children grew out of. What do you do with the ones you keep?

Wax the tables and wooden surfaces Translation: You can’t really wax your tables with paper, pens, and any other assortment of items all over it. Sort these items into categories. For example; Office supplies Children’s artwork Bills Groceries/food items Then, put everything away, category by category, until your tables are all cleared off. You can start eating dinner at the table again!  5. Clean window treatments You probably should clean your window treatments. This would be a good time to throw them in the laundry. It will help reduce the amount of dust in the air, and allergies! Achoo!  6. Sweep, mop, and wax the floors T Translation: Pick everything up off of the floors. Sort them into categories like; Laundry Trash Toys Hygiene/ bathroom items Dishes Pens, crayons, markers, art supplies Things you need to file (receipts, insurance policies, warranties) Then, work on putting everything away, category by category, until you can walk around without stepping on Legos.  7. Dust refrigerator coils Translation: Instead, you can go through everything in your fridge. Throw out anything that is past its expiration (whether it is moldy or not). Sort your items into categories like dairy, meats, fruits, vegetables, and condiments.  8. Switch out blankets This one is actually a good one. Swap your microfiber sheets for cotton or silk ones. Change out your down comforter for a summer quilt.  9. Mattresses  While you’re at it, you can flip or turn your mattresses, so they don’t wear too much on one side or another. You’ll save money because it will reduce wear and tear.  10. Clean out the closets If you don’t feel like going through every single item in your closet, at least switch out your fall and winter clothes for spring and summer ones. Store your coats, heavy jackets, gloves, scarves, and hats together in a tote. Put long sleeves, sweaters, thermals, and sweat pants into another. Put the totes away so they aren’t in the way. Don’t forget to label your totes, or you will forget that you even had the stuff to begin with.  One way to get out of doing this every season is to do a little at a time, every day. If you set aside 5 minutes to sort through & file your mail every day, or 10 minutes to clear the floors then your home will start to look better and better.    7 Steps to Get Organized June 11, 2015    You have several areas in your home that need organizing, how do you know where to begin? It can be overwhelming, but these few tips will help you conquer the task. You can start by answering these questions: Which area is used most often, or has the most traffic? Will organizing this area give you more space or resources to aid in completing your other projects? (For example: organizing my bedroom will give me more room to organize my closet later). Is this project critical in order to get something else done?  1. Pick Your Project Use the questions listed above! You want to create a big impact with each organization project. This will help you see the most progress. It might not be what you WANT to do, but it’s what you need to do first.  2. Set Goals What do you want to accomplish during your organizing project? Your goals need to be realistic, and specific. For example, I will sort through all of my clothing and decide what to keep, donate, and throw away by 5pm tomorrow.  3. Make Room You will need a clean, clear work space to organize with. Whether you are organizing paper, files, jewelry, clothing, or even dishes. It will save the stress of trying to work around other messes, and you will be less likely to lose things.  4. Categorize Sort your items into categories. This will make it easier to put similar things close to one another, and you will be less likely to forget where you put them.  5. Give it a Home Each item in your home or office should have a permanent “home,” or a place that it goes back to EVERY TIME it is removed. If an item doesn’t have a home, you need to decide whether you need it or not. If you DO need it, create a home for it.  6. Stay on Track Do you often find yourself doing side-projects that you never intended to do? Put this side-project on the back burner for now. The fewer projects that you are involved with at one time, the faster you will be able to to complete your main project. It will keep you more motivated to know that you’re knocking projects out, one-by-one.  7. Maintain Take 5 minutes a day to file your mail, 10 minutes to fold laundry, or put things back exactly where you found them. You will have much more time to live a stress-free, clutter-free life if you do a little every day.    What Does a Professional Organizer Do? June 1, 2015     Many people ask us, what does a professional organizer do?  Not all organizing consultations are dramatic makeovers like you see on TV. Most jobs are done with only one or two organizers. Professional organizers will come to your home or office and help you create an organizing system, while teaching you valuable, lifelong organization skills that will help you STAY organized.  Do I have to throw things away?  A professional organizer won’t force you to get rid of anything, or throw something away without your permission. You will always get to make the final decision on what happens to your belongings. It’s all a part of the process! With you in the driver’s seat, we are able to create a customized system that will work for you, long-term. Your organizer will also guide you through making difficult decisions.  Do I have to be there while you organize?  An organizer will organize along side you, so that you can learn methods to stay organized on your own. Think of it as a learning experience. You get pointers along the way, coaching, and mentoring in addition to a gorgeous, new, workable area of your home/office. Some clients really get into the organizing and have fun with it, which makes it an awesome experience for both of us!  Is it like a cleaning service?  Professional organizers typically don’t clean, (sweep, mop, sanitize, wash laundry or dishes) for you. There are cleaning services specifically for that. We help you develop and implement creative solutions to your space. We want to help transfer our knowledge to you in a hands-on environment, so you can gain new skills to live a clutter-free life.  How long will it take?  That depends, how big is the space? How much stuff do you have? Do you take more time to make decisions? A professional organizer will want to view the area, and may suggest a package that will work best for you. To schedule a 1-hour consultation, contact us. We’ll be able to help you come up with a game plan for organizing your space. To find a list of services, visit our Services page.     4002 W. TRACY ST.
