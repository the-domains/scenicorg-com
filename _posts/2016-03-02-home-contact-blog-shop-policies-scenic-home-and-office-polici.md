HOME CONTACT BLOG SHOP POLICIES Scenic Home & Office Policies Minimum Booking Requirement There is a 4-hour minimum for organizing sessions. We've determined this to be the prime amount of time for our clients to begin to see real results. Satisfaction Guarantee If you're not satisfied upon completion of your service, Scenic Home & Office Organizers will return for a free session to better meet your needs and work with you until you're completely satisfied with the results. Failure to make a claim in writing within seven business days implies that Client fully accepts the completed work. Travel fee, when applicable, still applies. Travel Policy We travel up to 50 miles from Springfield, MO free of charge. All necessary travel expenses will be discussed and agreed upon prior to service completion. Contact us by phone or e-mail to find out about specific travel expenses. And just like that, Scenic will be wherever you need them to be! Payment Policy We accept payment by cash, check (payable to Scenic Home & Office Organizers), money order, and debit/credit card. Payments for individual services or service packages are due at the end of the first session. Billable time begins once a Scenic Home & Office organizer arrives at your home or office location and ends when each session is completed. ï»¿ Check Policy By using a check for payment, you agree to the following terms: In the event that your check is dishonored or returned for any reason, you authorize us to electronically (or by paper draft) re-present the check to your bank account for collection of the amount of the check, plus any applicable fees as permitted by state law.
